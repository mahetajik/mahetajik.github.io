I am a PhD student at the University of Torontoâ€™s [Faculty of Information](https://ischool.utoronto.ca), specializing in Media, Technology, and Culture. My research explores how platform power is mediated, negotiated, and contested by integrating theoretical frameworks and methods from political economy, information systems, and strategic management. Specifically, I evaluate how social media platforms use *digital tools* to manage their relationships with content creators and third parties, including partners, data intermediaries, and advertisers. I am broadly interested in platform labour, the creator economy, and platform governance.
