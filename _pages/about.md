I am a Master of Information candidate at the [Faculty of Information](https://ischool.utoronto.ca) in the Critical Information Policy Studies stream at the University of Toronto, and I will be starting my PhD at the Faculty in September 2022. Prior to joining the Faculty of Information, I completed my Bachelor of Science in the [Integrated Science program](https://www.science.mcmaster.ca/sis/undergraduate/isci.html) at McMaster University, concentrating in biochemistry. 

Currently, I am an academic health sciences library intern at the [Gerstein Science Information Centre](https://gerstein.library.utoronto.ca/), where I support the assessment, maintenance, and development of health science print and electronic collections and resources. I also assist with the creation of teaching material for knowledge syntheses workshops and the design and documentation of comprehensive search strategies.
