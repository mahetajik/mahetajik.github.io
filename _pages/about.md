I am a Master of Information candidate at the [Faculty of Information](https://ischool.utoronto.ca) in the Critical Information Policy Studies stream at the University of Toronto, and I will be starting my PhD at the Faculty in September 2022. Prior to joining the Faculty of Information, I completed my Bachelor of Science in the [Integrated Science program](https://www.science.mcmaster.ca/sis/undergraduate/isci.html) at McMaster University, concentrating in biochemistry.
